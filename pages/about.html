        Hello! My name is Francesco (Frank) Pira, I'm 22yo and live in Catania, Italy, where I study Computer Engineering and work as developer. I often describe myself as a curious mind striving for more.
        </p>
        <p>I've studied Mathematics and Physics in High School, taught myself English and how to code. I've worked as a self-employed computer technician and later as web developer in a small team I founded.
        </p>
        <p>
        During the last two years I joined <a href="http://eestec.net">EESTEC</a>, became president of the local committee and coordinator of the international IT team. I got in touch with the local startup scene and joined <a href="http://youthub.net">Youthub Catania</a>, an association focused on matching people's skills and organising startup related events (like the <i>Startup Weekend - Change Makers</i>, held in Syracuse last May).
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2015, with a colleague at university, I started a company, <a href="http://fileshute.com">Fileshute</a>.

    <h3>Other things I like</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Meeting people</b>
        A good chat is a good moment and with people I haven't met it's even better. Valuable things happen when people share their experiences and thoughts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Reading</b>
        This is a pleasure I don't want to miss. I read about programming, best practise, new technologies, startup stories and anything that can improve myself.
        <br>Sometimes I find myself reading thrillers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Jiu jitsu and running</b>
        I have to admit, I've fallen in love with jiu jitsu and the Japanese culture. There's so much to learn from them! Days I don't have gym lessons, I go running at sunset. It's my reset button.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>DIY</b>
        Something my father taught me. It's fun to tinker away from keyboard, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Traveling</b>
        Visiting new places and discovering new cultures widens your mind and challenge you. When I have the chance to leave, I always do.
