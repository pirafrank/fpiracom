### Update (2020 12 28)

Iâ€™ve removed `+python` (python2 support) from the `./configure` script because it looks like you can't use both versions 2 and 3 [in the same instance](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/779/how-do-i-get-vim-to-be-able-to-run-both-python-and-python3-on-a-linux-system-in). Also, as Ubuntu 20.04 comes with Python 3.8.5, I'm now linking against it and tell the script to use `python3` (because in Ubuntu 20.04 system `python` is 2.7).

Hi everyone, while customizing my `.vimrc` ([here]({{ data.social.github.url }}/dotfiles)), I found out Ubuntu 20.04 version of vim is a bit old and doesn't come with `+python3` support. So I wrote a quick snippet to build vim 8.2 from source with it, and a couple of features more.

Just check the images below for a quick comparison.

{% include image.html

desc="Stock vim from Ubuntu PPA (open in a new tab to zoom)"
%}

{% gist 8436327f2e59a5593fdbffd26d0e5fae %}

Then you should get something like this:

{% include image.html
url="/static/postimages/2020-11-30/stock_vim.png"
desc="Installed vim from sources (open in a new tab to zoom)"
%}

Please note that the scripts installs vim to `/usr/local/bin` and sets `alternatives` so that you can make it live along other vims, should you want to install other versions.

I hope it helps. Thanks for reading.
