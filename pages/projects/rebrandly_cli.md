### Why Rebrandly?

Simply put, they offer unlimited short url with custom domains (up to 100!). That's a ton more compared to bit.ly which offer just 500/month of them.

### Awesome! Requirements?

Python 2.7 is all you need. I designed rebrandly_cli to work with you already have installed on your Mac, Linux, etc. installation.
