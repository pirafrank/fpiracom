Check also [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks) I gave and [events]({{ site.baseurl }}/events) I've organised or been to.

Recently I've also put up a Telegram channel for [OPNsense Updates]({{ site.data.external.telegram-opnsense-updates }}) and one for [Apple Developer releases]({{ site.data.external.telegram-apple-dev-releases }}), with updates published as soon as they're out.

Help me pushing [this idea]({{ site.data.external.mozilla-connect-idea-1 }}) forward on Firefox on Mozilla Connect by voting it. Thank you.
