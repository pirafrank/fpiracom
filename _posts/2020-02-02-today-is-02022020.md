This is a (very) short blog post, but I think it's worth to make a small celebration for a day worth remembering: today's date is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

> *02 02 2020* or *2020 02 02*

It happens once in a millenium, the next one being on 03.03.3030 and we won't be there to tell for sure.

From a mathematical standpoint we are very lucky to be alive today. And it's even Sunday! Make this day a very special one for you and for people you love, and spend it the best you can.

Thanks for reading.
