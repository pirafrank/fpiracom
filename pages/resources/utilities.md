Here you can find a collection of tools, notes, resources, links and more I hope you'll find useful.

You may also want to checkout the [Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) for more.

#### Utilities

- [gen_index.py](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/970cbdb7542dab942da50cab408100d0) - Generate an `index.html` page with links to files in the same folder. Use case: access files in a folder (e.g. dir with PDFs files) from browser and avoid turning directory listing on in your webserver. Python 2.7.x required. (*)
- [Download an entire website](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/181360a3754abe79a5c8) - Short bash script. It uses wget. (*)
- [Copy URL Bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/5a4f6f56f3cf931ddf6b) - in Safari on Mac, copying the URL from the address bar can be tricky. This lets you quickly copy it with just 1 click and a CMD+C. It should work in other browsers, too.

#### Command line tools

- [PathPicker](https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker): Facebook PathPicker is a simple command line tool that solves the perpetual problem of selecting files out of bash output.
- [asciinema](http://asciinema.org): Record and share your terminal sessions. Supports copy/paste from the video.
