Hi, everybody, this post is more a PSA about my PGP key update and a proof of it for future reference.

I've superseded my PGP master key. The superseded key fingerprint is:

`8CE5 6166 AD46 3442 9E3A  CF7C 03F3 1E01 C9DC 0E67`

while the new key fingerprint is:

`00F1 7C2C 8570 B082 2DF0  2CC6 DC80 5C4B D79E C530`

I've updated my keybase profile accordingly.
