Git-crypt is a nice piece of software, it's great to keep sensible data secure in a repository. 

Unfortunately the official installation guide only supports Linux and Homebrew users. So what if you're a happy Macports user like me?

### Install the requirements

First step, you need to have Xcode and macports installed. Run ```gcc --version``` and ```g++ version``` to be sure you can compile the software.

Now install ```openssl``` and ```git``` (it is very likely you have them already installed). Actually ```git``` is not needed at compile time but at runtime.

```sh
$ sudo port install openssl git
```

Let's get the source

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:AGWA/git-crypt.git
$ cd git-crypt
```

### Compile errors

If we compiled it now, ```make``` would fail and you would get ```fatal error: 'openssl/aes.h' file not found```.

What's up? It turns macports libs are not seen by GCC and G++ by default.

### Fix!

To fix it, we have to edit ```bash_profile``` file

```sh
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
```

and add the lines below:

```sh
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include/
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include/
```

What have we done? We've just told GCC and G++ to look for headers also in Macports path.

Reload `.bash_profile` to apply the edits...

```sh
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

...and check the variables to be set.

```sh
$ env | grep C_INCLUDE_PATH
$ env | grep CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
```

Now let's try again to compile

```sh
$ make
```

It should be run smoothly.

So it's time to install git-crypt. For best practice, it's better to install it in `/usr/local`. To do so run:

```sh
$ sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
```

Happy encryption!
