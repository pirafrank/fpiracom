#### Utilities

- [Download an entire website](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/181360a3754abe79a5c8) - Short bash script. It uses wget. (*)
- [Copy URL Bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/5a4f6f56f3cf931ddf6b) - in Safari on Mac, copying the URL from the address bar can be tricky. This lets you quickly copy it with just 1 click and a CMD+C. It should work in other browsers, too.
