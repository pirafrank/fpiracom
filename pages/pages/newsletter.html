<p>
    A short newsletter about coding, tech, business and startups delivered <b>{{ site.data.social.nuzzel.frequency }}</b> to your inbox. The service is managed via <a href="{{ site.data.social.nuzzel.url }}">Nuzzel</a>. Content is based on my Twitter feed and shares then it is crunched by nuzzel's algorithm. From time to time, I hand-pick the stories and add posts from this blog. It's a good option for busy people with no time.
</p>
<p class="smaller-text">
    Six stories per {{ site.data.social.nuzzel.frequency }} email maximum. No spam. I won't disclose your email, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/terms">I promise</a>.
