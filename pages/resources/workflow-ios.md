Recipes I've created for the popular iOS app Workflow. I hope you find the one for you.

#### Utilities

- [Define Word](https://workflow.is/workflows/73248a1812004bfbaa122a0c83171764) - iOS doesn't have a standalone dictionary app like OS X. Use this to define any word using the built in iOS dictionary.
- [Save Media or PDFs](https://workflow.is/workflows/77c911cb3069427daa998d7d46ab74c2) - Pretty much a 'Save As...' option for iOS.
- [Save File from URL](https://workflow.is/workflows/178df20da74240d4961e924202257573) - Pretty much a 'Download As...' option for iOS.

#### For Safari

- [Duplicate Tab](https://workflow.is/workflows/62dd17d0c9614d70b9b653c1eaf7f55c) - Bringing 'Duplicate tab' option to Safari for iOS.

#### For Evernote

Evernote for iOS isn't as powerful as its Web or Android counterparts, so here's an easy-to-use solution. Notes will also have a *from workflow* tag for a later easy recognition.

- [Evernote Clip Article](https://workflow.is/workflows/a8fca839b66b4fcf84f771c74d4d8875) - Save a simplified version of the webpage in your default notebook. It works best with web articles.
- [Evernote Clip Article Pro](https://workflow.is/workflows/4a6fe5a05db44325a73eb85b3d4157c9) - Save a simplified version of the webpage in your default notebook. It works best with web articles. This Pro version comes with notebook and tags choice and option to open the app after clipping.
- [Evernote Save Bookmark](https://workflow.is/workflows/c373a2047f3c4ce9874cf8325fa6cdcf) - Save a bookmark for that webpage in default notebook. Express solution.
- [Evernote Save Bookmark Pro](https://workflow.is/workflows/b9ed8af01f2d4f9bb089cd968fd4bea9) - Save a bookmark for that webpage in default notebook. This Pro version comes with notebook and tags choice and option to open the app after clipping.

#### Social

- [Save to Pocket and Tweet](https://workflow.is/workflows/3e508f3afda446eabfd92a4c535f94b4) - Spot a nice article? Save it for later but tweet it.
