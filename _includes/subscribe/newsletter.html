<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>
    If none of the above works for you, you can get the best of both worlds by subscribing to my newsletter. It's a short one about coding, tech, business and startups and it is delivered {{ site.data.social.nuzzel.frequency }} to your inbox.
</p>
<p>
    The service is managed via <a href="{{ site.data.social.nuzzel.url }}">Nuzzel</a> and content is based on my twitter feed plus blog posts then it is crunched by nuzzel's algorithm. From time to time, I hand-pick the stories.
</p>
<p>
    Six stories per each {{ site.data.social.nuzzel.frequency }} email maximum. No spam. I won't disclose your email, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/terms">I promise</a>.

    You can help me to improve this, just <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contacts">reach me</a> with your feedback.

<p>
  Thank you for your interest.
