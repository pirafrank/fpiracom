A collection of tools, notes, links and more I hope you'll find useful.

You may also want to checkout the [Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/).

#### Utilities

- [Brute-force calculator online]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/bfc) (*) - Dummy-proof utility to calculate how long it takes to brute-force crack your password.
- [Copy URL Bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/5a4f6f56f3cf931ddf6b) - in Safari on Mac, copying the URL from the address bar can be tricky. This lets you quickly copy it with just 1 click and a CMD+C. It should work in other browsers, too.
- [Quit All Apps for macOS](https://cdn.fpira.com/public/mac/quit_all_apps_mac.zip) - A tiny application made using Automator to close all open apps at once.

#### Command line tools

- [gen_index.py](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/970cbdb7542dab942da50cab408100d0) (*) - Generate an `index.html` page with links to files in the same folder. Use case: access files in a folder (e.g. dir with PDFs files) from browser and avoid turning directory listing on in your webserver. Python 2.7.x required.
- [Download an entire website](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/181360a3754abe79a5c8) (*) - Short bash script. It uses wget.
- [YouTube uploader CLI](https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/20ecefda12e8bb47fe4eba59621b08ff) (*) - Quick script to automate video upload from CLI to YouTube. Based on [youtube-upload](https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload).

**Third-party CLI tools I recommend**

- [PathPicker](https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker) - Facebook PathPicker is a simple command line tool that solves the perpetual problem of selecting files out of bash output.
- [asciinema](http://asciinema.org) - Record and share your terminal sessions. Supports copy/paste from the video.

#### IFTTT
