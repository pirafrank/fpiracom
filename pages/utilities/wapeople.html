<p>
  Chat to someone without adding his/her mobile number to your contacts.
  <br>
  <strong>Works with iOS and Android apps as well as web version.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Type in mobile number of the person you want to chat with.
  <br>
  Only numbers. Country prefix required, without '+' sign (e.g. +393160909123).
</p>

<p>
<span class="input-box">
  <input type="text" name="mobile" value="" id="mobile"/>
  <a class="btn btn-small btn-default center-mobile" href="javascript:openChat()">Go</a>
</span>
</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Nothing special, it uses WhatsApp <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-use-click-to-chat">Click-to-chat</a> feature.</li>
  <li>It actually just opens an URL in another tab. The mobile is part of that URL.</li>
  <li>String concatenation happens on your browser. Your input won't be visible to me or any third part (other than WhatsApp itself) in any way.</li>
</ul>
