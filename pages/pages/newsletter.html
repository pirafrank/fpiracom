<h4>(Somewhat it's an experiment...)</h4>
<p>
    A short newsletter about coding, tech, business and startups delivered daily to your inbox. The service is managed via <a href="http://nuzzel.com/{{ site.social-links.nuzzel }}">Nuzzel</a>. Content is based on my Twitter feed and shares then crunched by nuzzel's algorithm. From time to time, I hand-pick the stories and add posts from this blog. It's a good option for busy people with no time.
</p>
<p class="smaller-text">
    Six stories per email per day maximum. No spam. I won't disclose your email, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/terms">I promise</a>.

    <a class="btn btn-big btn-default" href="http://nuzzel.com/{{ site.social-links.nuzzel }}">Subscribe</a>
</p>
<p class="smaller-text">
    Please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contacts">give me</a> your feedback. If this experiment provides me positive results, I'll start a (real) weekly newsletter with content 100% selected by me.
