Recently I've got interested in `nostr`, which is increasing in popularity, and I've jumped in.

Below, details on how to look for me.

#### Hex

`{{ site.data.social.nostr.pubkey.hex }}`

#### npub

`{{ site.data.social.nostr.pubkey.npub }}`

#### NIP-05

![{{ site.data.social.nostr.verify }}]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/pageimages/nostr/verified.png)

which is verified via DNS as per [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md).

NB. this isn't a real email address. Check [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/contacts) to get in touch.
