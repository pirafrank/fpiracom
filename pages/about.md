### Bio

Hello, my name is Francesco (Frank) Pira, I'm 23yo and live in Catania, Italy, where I study Computer Engineering and work as developer. I often describe myself as a curious mind striving for more.

My interests are web development, technology, big data, business and start-ups. Since I've started practising Jiu Jitsu, I got fascinated by the Japanese culture. I also like traveling and when I have the chance, I always do. Recently I've found out writing is one of my growing passions.

I've studied Mathematics and Physics in High School, taught myself English and how to code. I've also worked as a self-employed computer technician and in a small team I founded as web developer.

In 2013 I joined EESTEC, a European network of engineering students where members can improve technical and soft skills. The next year I became president of the local committee and coordinator of the International IT team. In 2015, with a colleague at university, I started a company, Fileshute.

I am currently involved in the local startup scene as start-upper and as VP of Youth Hub Catania, an association focused on matching people's skills and organising startup related events (like the Startup Weekend - Change Makers, held in Syracuse on May 2015).

### Projects

From time to time I write little utilities to help my work or just code for fun. I usually release them with open-source license on GitHub. Head over the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) page to find a list.

### Other things I like

**Meeting people** A good chat is a good moment and with people I haven't met it's even better. Valuable things happen when people share their experiences and thoughts.

**Reading** This is a pleasure I don't want to miss. I read about programming, best practise, new technologies, startup stories and anything that can improve myself.
Sometimes I find myself reading thrillers.

**Jiu jitsu and running** I have to admit, I've fallen in love with jiu jitsu and the Japanese culture. There's so much to learn from them! Days I don't have gym lessons, I go running at sunset. It's my reset button.

**DIY** Something my father taught me. It's fun to tinker away from keyboard, too.

**Traveling** Visiting new places and discovering new cultures widens your mind and challenge you. When I have the chance to leave, I always do.
