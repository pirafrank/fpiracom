One of my favourite Linux distros is Elementary OS, it is nice looking and pretty stable. But like any software it has some quirks. I've experienced, although rarely, the tray battery disappearing. Here’s a quick and easy way to bring it back.

Open the terminal and type:

```sh
$ mate-power-manager & 
```

That’s it! Easy, isn’t it?

Thanks for reading.
