Wunderlist is a great productivity tool with nice features. One of them is you can share a list publicly. It happens you want to embed the list in your website or any other HTML page. The code below help you in this.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.wunderlist.com/lists/123456789"; width="100%" height="500" name="My Shared List">
<p>Your browser cannot view embedded frames. Just click on the link to open the list: <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/lists/123456789">My Shared List</a></p>
</iframe>
```

#### Example

Your result should look like this. Of course you can tweak the width and height to better fit yoru needs.

(Put an example into the page!)

Thanks for reading.
