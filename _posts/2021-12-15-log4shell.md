This weekend a new 0-day has been published and the web was set to fire. The vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) and flagged with *Critical* severity, it affects Java code importing the very popular log4j logging library. As we can read on [Log4j security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html): *An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled*.

It is being [actively exploited](https://blog.cloudflare.com/actual-cve-2021-44228-payloads-captured-in-the-wild/), so I encourage you to update to a patched version and deploy remediations ASAP.

### How it works

Log4shell works by sending a maliciously crafted string as value of a request header to web services depending on log4j, allowing remote code execution to the attacker in an environment where he controls LDAP servers and other JNDI related endpoints. Such environment could be the Internet itself. That kind of criticity recalls Shellshock from 2014 and because of this has been named *Log4Shell*.

To go deeper on how it works, please head over this well-written articles on [naked security](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/12/13/log4shell-explained-how-it-works-why-you-need-to-know-and-how-to-fix-it/) and [Snyk blog](https://snyk.io/blog/log4j-rce-log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-4428/).

### Who is affected and mitigations

Even major providers like [Apple](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) ([now patched](https://eclecticlight.co/2021/12/12/last-week-on-my-mac-when-the-internet-caught-fire/comment-page-1/)), twitter, [Minecraft](https://mashable.com/article/log4shell-biggest-computer-vulnerability), [Microsoft](https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/12/microsoft-log4j-exploits-extend-past-crypto-mining-to-outright-theft/) and Amazon are affected ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/10/software-flaw-most-critical-vulnerability-log-4-shell)).

Vulnerable versions are those from `2.0-beta9` to `2.14.1`. The patched one is the recently released `2.15.0`, which disables the lookup behaviour by default.

**Update**: Recently released version `2.15.0` has been found to have a [moderate security vulnerability](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) ([CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046)). Now the version you should update to is `2.16.0`.

For versions after `2.10.0` you can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling JndiLookup. You can do it by setting the env var `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true` or by running the jar with the property `formatMsgNoLookups=true`, e.g: `java -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true -jar myapp.jar`.

JDK versions greater than 6u211, 7u201, 8u191, and 11.0.1 are not impacted by the LDAP attack vector because in these versions `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase` is set to `false` ([source](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/)), yet [DNS is being used](https://blog.cloudflare.com/actual-cve-2021-44228-payloads-captured-in-the-wild/) as JNDI endpoint so upgrading is still strongly recommended.

Spring-boot, per [their statement](https://spring.io/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-vulnerability-and-spring-boot), is affected only if you use log4j2 as the default logging system. More specifically, *only applications using log4j-core and including user input in log messages are vulnerable*, meaning that if you use `spring-boot-starter-logging` (which depends on `log4j-to-slf4j` and `log4j-api`) your application is safe. Check your pom to know if you use it and have to upgrade.

Cloudflare [has written](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cve-2021-44228-log4j-rce-0-day-mitigation/) about how they have already deployed a mitigation throught their WAF to both free and paid users. Also, Microsoft has published [a guide](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/) about their solutions via *Microsoft 365 Defender* and *Defender for Cloud* products.

Remaining in the cloud world, HAProxy developers have [recently announced](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/december-2021-log4shell-mitigation) that their products are not impacted because they do not use log4j2.

### An alternative mitigation

If you can't update the library shortly, e.g. for some older projects, an alternative is to deploy an nginx instance with some Lua scripts and expose the services throught the (reverse) proxy so that malicious headers do not pass to the Java backend behind ([link](https://www.infiniroot.com/blog/1155/using-nginx-lua-script-mitigate-log4shell-cve-2021-44228-vulnerability)).

Of course similar solutions can be deployed with other products.

### Further considerations

You may find yourself using log4j `1.2.x`, for example on a couple of old projects. If you are still including it, you should upgrade ASAP since it reached end of life in 2015 and hasn't included security fixes for a while. It is vulnerable to other remote code execution attacks, like CVE-2019-17571, which has been discovered in 2019 and is somewhat similar to the one discovered this weeekend ([link](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17571/)).

Log4j developers strongly recommend to upgrade to version `2.x` (as written [here](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/)), and considering the latest news I advise you to update at least to version `2.16.0`. A guide to do so is available on the dedicated [Apache website](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html).

Hope it helps. Thanks for reading.
