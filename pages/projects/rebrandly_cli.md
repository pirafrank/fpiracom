### What is *rebrandly cli*?

Rebrandly_cli is an unofficial command line client for [Rebrandly](http://rebrandly.com).

You can use it to shorten your URLs with ease, without leaving the terminal. Look at the example below to have an idea.

{% asciinema 94415 %}

### Why Rebrandly?

Simply put, they offer unlimited short links for free, even using custom domains. That's a ton more compared to bit.ly which offers just 500 short links/month.

### Awesome! Requirements?

Python 2.7 is all you need. I designed rebrandly_cli to work with what you already have installed on your Mac or Linux. It should work also on Windows if you install Python.

### How to use it?

Please read the [readme](https://github.com/pirafrank/rebrandly_cli/blob/master/README.md) file for full and updated information.
