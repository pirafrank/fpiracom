# Climate has changed

But it's not too late to act.

---

Climate change is a global challenge that affects everyone, everywhere. And it will in the future more and more, changing our lives. It's already here, and it's time to act. Every year is the hottest year on record, and the impacts of climate change are becoming more severe, more frequent. From extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires to rising sea levels, melting ice caps, and disappearing species, the evidence of climate change is all around us.

The solution is not around the corner, and it's not easy. It requires a global effort from everyone, from governments and corporations, to individuals. We are required to change our habits, our way of living, but most of all our way of thinking. We all have a role to play, it's not a choice, it's a duty as human beings. It's about our survival as species.

#### How we can help

We can help by donating, volunteering our time, or spreading the word. Raising awareness is the first step to creating change. First the people around us, then everyone else up to the istitutions. The only possible solutions come from a bottom-up approach, and it starts from us. Every little bit helps.
