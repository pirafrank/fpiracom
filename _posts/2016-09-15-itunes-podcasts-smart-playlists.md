Apple does not offer a default way to filter downloaded podcasts. Manually looking for them in the feed so time consuming, no one would do that. But iTunes has been having a cool feature called *Smart playlist* for a long time. That help us out. 

1. Open iTunes
2. Go to Podcasts > My Podcasts
3. Click in an empty space in the left sidebar, then *New smart playlist*
4. Set the rules like this:
  4.1. *Match podcasts for all the following rules*
  4.2. *Media kind* is *Podcast*
  4.3. *Location* is *on this computer*
  4.4. Uncheck *Limit to...*
  4.5. Uncheck *Match only checked items*
  4.6. Be sure *Live updating* is enabled for new downloaded podcasts to be added to the playlist)
5. Done!

Unfortunately this is not something that can be also done on iOS, but there's a cool app that has this feature (an many more), [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/).

Thank you for reading.
