### Bio

Hello, my name is Francesco (Frank) Pira, I'm 27yo and live in Catania, Italy, where I part-time study Computer Engineering and work as developer. I often describe myself as a curious mind striving for more.

My interests are programming (especially web development), technology, big data, business and start-ups. I like working in team on projects that challenge me and I'm fascinated by finding the *best practice* in doing something. I also like advising and motivating on topics I'm skilled. Recently I've found out writing is one of my growing passions.

I've studied Mathematics and Physics in High School, taught myself English and how to code. I've also worked as a self-employed computer technician and in a small team I founded as web developer.

In 2013 I joined EESTEC, a European network of engineering students where members can improve technical and soft skills. The next year I became president of the local committee and coordinator of the International IT team. In 2015, with a colleague at university, I started a company, Fileshute.

I have been involved in the local startup scene as start-upper and as VP of Youth Hub Catania, a no-profit association focused on enabling and supporting young entrepreneurship, matching people's skills and organising startup related events (like [#AppIdee](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppIdee?src=hash) and Startup Weekends).

Today I work as back-end developer at [Leonardo Company](http://leonardocompany.com/en). There are many projects I'm involved in, mainly Java ones running in Docker or IBM WebSphere, while others built on Oracle Middleware platform.

I'm tuned to Apple security news and I think GUIs are largely overrated. My daily carry is an iPad moshed to zsh and nvim. If you're curious about my setup, feel free to check my [dotfiles]({{site.data.social.github.url}}/dotfiles) repo and [toolbelt]({{site.baseurl}}/my-toolbelt) page.

### Other things I like

**Meeting people** A good chat is a good moment and with people I haven't met it's even better. Valuable things happen when people share their experiences and thoughts.

**Reading** This is a pleasure I don't want to miss. I read about programming, best practice, new technologies, startup stories and anything that can improve myself.
Sometimes I find myself reading thrillers.

**Jiu jitsu and running** I have to admit, I've fallen in love with jiu jitsu and the Japanese culture. There's so much to learn from them! Days I don't have gym lessons, I go running at sunset. It's my reset button.

**DIY** Something my father taught me. It's fun to tinker away from keyboard, too.

**Traveling** Visiting new places and discovering new cultures widens your mind and challenges you. When I have the chance to leave, I always do.

Plus, every now and then I find quotes and media that inspire me. They are listed below.
