# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Supporting the Ukrainian people

<br>

Since Russian troupes invaded Ukraine war broke out.

In such a delicate and complicated situation, my prayers and thoughts go to the Ukrainian people who are the most suffering because of that, and to Russian people who risk their life protesting against a war they did not ask. I sincerely hope diplomacy will ultimately win over bombs and missiles.

Every bit of help can be precious: from writing to your representatives, to organizing and peacefully protesting, to donating money. If you feel so, I put a few links down below to donate to trustworthy organizations trying to defend and take care of the Ukrainian people.
