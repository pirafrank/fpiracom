Don't you know Alfred? Know about it [here](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

You can get workflows and themes I've developed from links below.

#### Workflows

Source files and the latest stable version are available on [Github](https://github.com/pirafrank/alfred_workflows).

I also publish workflows on [Packal]({{ site.data.social.packal.url }}).

#### Themes

A zip archive with them all is available [here]({{ site.data.external.alfredthemes }}).

#### Noteworthy 3rd-party workflows
