I usually don't write posts for CVEs, preferring to quickly [retweet]({{site.data.social.twitter.url}}) security news instead. But this is a big one and I want it to stick on the blog.

#### The vuln

`CVE-2020-0601` has been disclosed. It affects all editions of Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019. The vulnerability lives in Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) and allows an attacked to spoof Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates by crafting one that appears to be valid (trust chain resolved up to root CA). Such certificate could be used, for example, to sign a malware thus making it look legitimate. This critical vulnerability has been patched as part of today *patch Tuesday*. More details [here](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0601).

#### Making noise

The news is currently making noise in the security community for the criticality of the news yet for the curious fact the NSA [announced it](https://twitter.com/NSAGov/status/1217152211056238593) and somehow [offering support](https://twitter.com/NSAGov/status/1217196946634563584).

While [Microsoft says](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/01/14/january-2020-security-updates-cve-2020-0601/) they "have not seen it used in active attacks", [it is](https://twitter.com/x0rz/status/1217176591765319680) [believed](https://twitter.com/0x00C651E0/status/1217167151049527296) this is an older bug the agency has kept for itself and just decided to publish for yet unknown reasons, one of which may be *good PR*.

Since a picture is worth a 1000 words, here it is a [funny explanation](https://twitter.com/kennwhite/status/1217186865016602632) in classic twitter style.

Patch is available as part of today patch Tuesday. You can get it from Windows Update. Of course, update as soon as you can.

Thanks for reading.
