As a developer, I often use an external monitor. Full-screen apps are a great feature in OS X to work without distraction and enjoy all your screen estate, but for keyboard lovers like me waiting for the top bar to show is pain. 

Sometimes the overscan hides part of the external display area. I managed to sort this out without having to remove hands from the keyboard.

Simply use `Control+Command+F` to toggle full-screen in an app.

Thanks for reading.
