During the Google I/O Extended 2016 held in Catania on 18th-20th May I had the chance to give an introductory speech about JavaScript, ES6 and node.js. Those are tech I use daily to develop back-end and cross-platform desktop applications.

I was pleased to see the number of participants was above both my and organizers expectation. It was really nice as I could give the young and curious attendees the getting started they were looking for.

Sounds interesting? Below you can find the slides I used and some links you may want to check out.
